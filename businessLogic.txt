ðŸ”¹ Business Logic (No Auth Version)
1. User

A user can be created directly (just name + email, no password yet).

A user can be listed (view all users).

A user can be deleted â†’ their posts and comments should also be deleted (cascade delete).

A user can be updated (e.g., change name/email).

2. Post

A user can create a post â†’ must have a userId (the author).

Anyone can fetch all posts.

Posts should include their authorâ€™s details.

Posts should also include all comments.

A user can update or delete only their own posts (but for now, since no authentication, you can enforce this manually by checking userId).

3. Comment

A comment must always belong to both:

A postId (which post itâ€™s attached to)

A userId (who wrote it)

A user can create a comment on any post.

Comments should be fetched along with:

The post they belong to

The user who wrote them

A user can update or delete only their own comments (same as above, check userId).

ðŸ”¹ Example Flows (without auth)

Create a Post:

Input: title, content, userId

Check: user exists?

Save post with reference to user.

Get Posts:

Return posts with author + all comments (nested with commenter info).

Add Comment:

Input: content, postId, userId

Check: user exists? post exists?

Save comment.

Delete User:

Remove user â†’ cascade remove their posts â†’ cascade remove comments under those posts.
